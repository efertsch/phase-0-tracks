# Inquiry into jQuery: 2 Hour Time-Box 

The approach described below represents a good leanring workflow in which multiple resources are used to first, understand the background, application, and basics of jQuery. Then, interactive tutorials can serve as a supplement to the previously obtained foundation. A short break in between is important both physically and mentally for information retention. 

## 1. Understand uses, applications, and installation

Estimated Time: 45 min

Resources:
* Javascript & jQuery - John Duckett
* Tutorialspoint
* Other various online resources (w3 schools, jQuery Fundamentals )


#BREAK - 15 minutes (short walk/stretching)

## 2. Review Previously Completed CodeAcademy Course

Etimated Time: 1 hr 

* To be used a supplement for concepts in which a solid example is needed 
* Utilize forum and glossary as needed for syntax 
* Investigate other interactive learning applications if time permits 
* Play around in sublime as necessary 



## Reflections:

Took extensive notes including links to useful sites, book marked many pages referenced in tutorials. 

Taking a break in between learning sessions was useful.

I found it to me more helpful use w3 schools and tutorials point for learning because they have interactive portions to them.

CodeAcademy was confusing to go through again (cannot re-start course once it has already been taken).

Plan to start release 3 and refer back to tutorials and Duckett book for reference as needed.
