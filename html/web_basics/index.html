	<h1>Hello World: My Journey into the world of Programming</h1>
		<p>
			I started exploring how to code in October of 2014. I was inspired by Python and the data analysis my PI performed for our laboratory. However, I wanted to move away from the biological sciences and find a more creative, <em>fulfilling</em> path. I started taking courses on CodeAcademy and realized my passion for programming and knew it was something I wanted to build my life around. One year later, I began my education at Dev Bootcamp.
