<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to give additional meaning to HTML components/sections and provide additional information about a page to users, especially those who are visually impaired or use screen readers. I think that the nav, headers, and footers are most useful to a typical user, it is really frustrating when I come across a page that does not make internal and/or external navigation simple and obvious. Though I can't speak from the point of view of someone who is visually disabled/impaired, I can imagine that there are many other semantic elements that are incredibly useful.  -->

<!-- Browsers display elements in order from top to bottom.  -->

<!-- I learned that sublime will be more useful than I though, I didn't realize it was so easily modulated on the end of the user. I would love to create snippets in the future but for now (phase 0) I plan to type out all of my code to get more practice -->

<!-- The most challenging thing for me during this GPS was creating the snippet, I was initially unsure which parts of the guiding notation were to be deleted. I also tried to add the decription feature that was in the sublime literature and not given as part of the template but that did not work so I will have to be mindful of that moving forward as I create snippets, and as always, practice makes perfect.  -->
