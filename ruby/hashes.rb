# Create Client_Info Hash

	client_name: "", 
	client_age: 40,
	number_of_children: "",

#Test for hash functionality with empty strings, boolean, and integer
p Client_Info 

# Add key/value pairs to hash with strings, integers, and booleans 


# Keys should be symbols
# Test to make sure hash is functional
# Add UI to collect client infomation
# Convert user input to appropriate data type
# Print hash when client has answered all questions 
# Give the user the opportunity to update a key - if "none" skip 
# If user wishes to make change, ask for new value and update the key
# Print latest version of the hash 
# Exit the program
