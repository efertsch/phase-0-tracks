# Create Client_Info Hash 
Client_Info = {}
# Add key/value pairs to hash with strings, integers, and booleans 
# Keys should be symbols
# Test to make sure hash is functional
# Add UI to collect client infomation
# Convert user input to appropriate data type
# Print hash when client has answered all questions 
# Give the user the opportunity to update a key - if "none" skip 
# If user wishes to make change, ask for new value and update the key
