# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

Version control allows users to organize and effectively share files by tracking revision history over the life of a project or file. Version control is useful because it allows for tracking edits and sharing files which helps to protect code and software. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

All repositories created have a master branch that can be thought of as the default branch. Additional branches represent duplications of the master branch that be edited and subsequently merged by one or more users without compromising the integrity and functionality of the master branch during the revision process. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a save point in Git to be used after a file has been edited. A commit always includes a commit message that describes the edits or changes made the file. A good commit message is relatively brief, specifically describes the edits or changes made, and is written in the present tense.  

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when a user is attempting to integrate or merge one branch with another branch and the content is inconsistent. When branches are merged an index of the different files is created and compared (original, edited, merged). If those files present with conflict the user will be presented with a merge conflict. Luckily, with some backtracking merge conflicts can be resolved.
